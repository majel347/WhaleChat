         <p> <em> Whale Chat</em> was developed by Majel Peters as part of the Fall 23 Digital History course taught by Dr. Anne Valk at the CUNY Graduate Center. It was developed to investigate and document the intermingling of academic and cultural history and memory practices and convenes several points in time as a way of maintaining, building and activating the vibrancy of the historical knowledge. While answering the archivist Michelle Caswell’s call to “activate the archive,” by providing access to an obscure archival item that offers insight on the continuous expressions of Wampanoag agency and activism, the project also functions as part of my personal and continuous practice of immersion in the constant flow of my ancestral inheritance. 
        
            <p> An excerpt of the conversation between Ramona Peters and Dr. Jason Mancini, at the heart of the project. The original recording was made on August 17, 2013 at the <a href="https://mashpeewampanoagtribe-nsn.gov/museum"> Mashpee Indian Tribal Museum</a>. Peters and Mancini were collaborating on the gathering of exhibit materials for whaling exhibits they were independantly developing. The recording offers a richly informative and entertaining demonstration of the method by which our histories inherently exist on multiple planes.  In traditionally academic settings, we are often pinned down to linear progression—the building up of narrative as points plotted on timelines and assessed for meaning. Peters’ and Mancini’s conversation demonstrates how our shared knowledge and experience of it permeates time and place—it exists all at once. As we listen, they weave together own associations across all points in time inspired by the other’s knowledge. The leap backward and forward in time and from place to place to create complex patterns of interconnectivity. They pose questions that ask us to consider the vast and intricate connections Indigenous whalers have made across space: bringing both afar and back home new ideas and technologies; and time: memory of the presence and  actions living on the histories and traditions of the lands they visited. The underpinning of each story, is the water. The oceans and seas acting as conduits for not just transportation of physical bodies but ideas, inspiration, and hope.
